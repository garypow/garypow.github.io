    Here are some of the jokes I remembered, & a few Confucious ones as well.
    <br>
    The elephant jokes are really funny, & I'm sure there are lots more than what I have shown.
    <br>
    Obviously, there are certain jokes that I don't remember all that well, or have forgotten, as my teen years were a long time ago, & that's when I used to know a lot of jokes but overall, what I have written is what I have remembered.
    <br>
    If I remember more & it's a good one, then I'll update the site.

      This page, was built from a <strong>love of Potatoes</strong> 🥔🥔🥔🍺. I hope you enjoy reading!.
