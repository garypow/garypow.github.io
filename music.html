        I was fortunate to have been brought up in an era, of fantastic music. The 60's, 70's, and 80's were decades of incredible musical diversity, with new genres emerging and existing genres evolving rapidly.
        <br>
        <span>T</span>here were so many new bands & individual singers during this period, producing so many different types of music. Some bands made it big, while others were a one hit wonder.
        <br>
        <span>H</span>ere are some of the most popular types of music from each decade:
<br>
        60's:

            Rock and Roll
            Motown
            Soul
            Folk
            Psychedelic Rock
            Surf Rock
            Pop
<br>
          
        70's:

            Classic Rock
            Disco
            Funk
            Soul
            Reggae
            Progressive Rock
            Punk Rock
 <br>
          
          80's:

            New Wave
            Synthpop
            Hair Metal
            Hip Hop
            Pop
            Soft Rock
            Hard Rock
            Heavy Metal
        <span>M</span>aths I found quite hard OR I didn't pay attention (definitely the latter)
        <br>
        <span>I</span> only really studied maths after I left school, as it played a big part in electronics & flying. Pretty pleased with myself as I did it all on my own.
        <br>
        <span>I</span> was pretty good in English & got first place in the 'Rhodesia Trust Exam'.

        <br>
        <span>G</span>eography was a great subject learning simple things like how to calculate the height of a mountain. Measure the distance between two points on the ground, and then measure the angles between the top of the mountain and each point."If you have two angles, you know the third, because the sum of the angles is 180 degrees. Easy!!

        <br>
        <span>M</span>usic was one of my favourite classes, & I was always interested in playing the piano, but never took it up. Opted for guitar instead.
        <br>
        <span>S</span>cience I used to love, doing all those experiments, & not knowing what the results will be & half the time blew things up.


      <br>
      <span>F</span>rench! I hated it & the teacher Mr. Kinsella. French always sounds like (Naw eee Naw eee Naw)

      <br>
      <span>H</span>ated P.E. We had this P.E. teacher named (Dop). We gave him this nick name because he was always drunk. Tried to have his wicked way with the dormitory matron (not sure from our school OR Mabelreign Girls High). Think he got sacked from his job after she made an official complaint.

      <br>
      <span>T</span>here was of course Sports. I liked Cricket & Swimming and that was it. Not sure if we had any others.
      <br>
      <br>
      <span>T</span>hen of course there was the bully (Dave Cliffane). Had my share of bullying from him & his gang. They were all mouth when they were all together, but when they are on their own, a different story.
      <br>
      <span>T</span>hat's exactly what happened when me & a friend were bullied by this gang & this so called leader hit both of us in the mouth for no reason at all. We were just chatting & he decided that we were chatting about him. Anyway I went home with a blood filled mouth & a swollen lip, & Chris asked me what happened, & so I told him. If I rememeber, we were all in the same class together, for some unknown reason.
      <span>A</span>nyway this bully put his hand up & asked if he could go to the toilet. As soon as the teacher had said yes, Chris stuck his hand up & asked if he could go to the toilet. Now the teacher knew what was going on here & that this bloke was a right bully, so that's why he let Chris go at the same time. Well! not to miss out on this one time meeting between Chris & the "Ellis Robins Hard Nut", I stuck my hand up & asked if I could go to the toilet. The teacher said yes with a smile on his face.
      <span>W</span>ell once we were inside the toilet, Chris just pulverized him, & he was shouting at Chris saying that his older brother was going to get him & beat him up. Well the best bit was that Chris & I were on our bikes & the bully's big brother stopped Chris & said something like "You like beating up my brother, why don't you try it with me," & on that point Chris pulverized the bully's brother as well, & from that day on, no one was bullied by them 2 anymore. Great days. 🤼‍♂️ 🥇
      <br>
      <br>
      <span>A</span>fter school, Me & a few others would go swimming, either at Meryck Park or Mabelreign. I can still remember Mr. Parrington who used to own Mabelreign pool. Used to have swimming lessons with him, which was boring half the time, as we were there just to mess about & have fun.
      <br>
      <br>
      <span>I</span>f we didn't go swimming, it's because there was a fight after school behind the shed where the bikes were parked. Had some big trees there so if you were early enough, to watch it, you could get a birds eye view from a well placed branch.
