<h2>Cessna 150</h2>

<p>
  The Cessna 150 is a two-seat tricycle gear general aviation airplane that was designed for flight training, touring and personal use. In 1977 it was succeeded in production by the Cessna 152, a minor modification to the original design.

  The Cessna 150 is the fifth most produced aircraft ever, with 23,839 produced. The Cessna 150 was offered for sale in the 150 basic model, Commuter, Commuter II, Patroller and the aerobatic Aerobat models.

  In 2007 Cessna announced a successor to the Model 150 and 152, the <a class = "nolink" href="#" target="_blank">Model 162 Skycatcher.

    <span class = "mumdadtooltipcolour"><img class = "skycatcherimage" src= "images/cessnas/skycatcher.jpg" alt="image" width="370" height="250">
      <br>
    This is the Model 162 Skycatcher.
    <br>
    <br>
    It's an American side-by-side two-seater.
    <br>
    <br>
    It was produced by Cessna between December 2009 and December 2013.
    <br>
    <br>
    At one time 1200 Skycatchers had been ordered.
    <br>
    <br>
    Only 192 aircraft had been sold before production ended in 2013.
    <br>
    <br>
    The remaining 80 unsold aircraft were used for parts.
    <br>
    <br>
    December 2016 when the remaining aircraft were scrapped.

<h2>Cessna 152</h2>

<p>
  The Cessna 152 is an American two-seat, fixed-tricycle-gear, general aviation airplane, used primarily for flight training and personal use. It was based on the earlier Cessna 150 incorporating a number of minor design changes and a slightly more powerful engine with a longer time between overhaul.

  The Cessna 152 has been out of production for more than thirty years, but many are still airworthy and are still in regular use for flight training.
</p>

<br>

<h2>Cessna 172</h2>

<p>
  The Cessna 172 Skyhawk is an American four-seat, single-engine, high wing, fixed-wing aircraft made by the Cessna Aircraft Company. First flown in 1955, more 172s have been built than any other aircraft. It was developed from the 1948 Cessna 170 but with tricycle landing gear rather than conventional landing gear. The Skyhawk name was originally used for a trim package, but was later applied to all standard-production 172 aircraft, while some upgraded versions were marketed as the Cutlass.

  Measured by its longevity and popularity, the Cessna 172 is the most successful aircraft in history. Cessna delivered the first production model in 1956, and as of 2015, the company and its partners had built more than 44,000 units. The aircraft remains in production today.

  The Skyhawk's main competitors have been the Beechcraft Musketeer and Grumman AA-5 series (neither currently in production), the Piper Cherokee, and, more recently, the Diamond DA40 and Cirrus SR20.
</p>

<br>

<h2>Cessna 182 Skylane</h2>

<p>
  The Cessna 182 Skylane is an American four-seat, single-engined light airplane built by Cessna of Wichita, Kansas. It has the option of adding two child seats in the baggage area.

  Introduced in 1956, the 182 has been produced in a number of variants, including a version with retractable landing gear, and is the second-most popular Cessna model still in production after the 172.
