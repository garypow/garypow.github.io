          When I left Ellis Robins school, I started Working for Piero Diliberto in Jameson avenue. It was quite exciting in the beginning, as it was my first working experience, but after the second year, I hated the job, & I knew this wasn't what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. So after the 4 years was up, I left the company. That was the one & only job I had in Rhodesia.
          <br>
          <span>W</span>hen I arrived in Margate UK, I started work at 'Dreamland Amusement Park' on one of the stands as a bingo caller. That was good fun, calling in the tourists, & trying to get them to play. After that I worked for a Cypriot guy named Savas in Margate High Street. After work, in the evenings, I had a part time job at a pub called (Click--><a class = "cottageclass" href = "http://www.dover-kent.com/Pubs/Cottage-Margate.html" alt="The Cottage Image" target="_blank"> "The Old Cottage Pub").</a> I absolutely loved working there, serving the customers & I made so many friends there & the bosses Mrs Watson & her son Bob always made sure I was looked after.  I also learnt all aspects of running a pub, & they just gave me a free hand running it. I was doing all the ordering for the bar, not only the alcohol side of the pub business, but everything else that goes with it, I would also get involved with planning events, calculating the quantities required & make sure there was enough stock on hand to complete the event. The only downside to the job was when the pub closed after last orders & when everything was clean & tidy, I had to get a bus back to Garlinge, where I was living which meant by the time I got home it was 12:30 - 1:00am. Then of course I had to get up the next morning for my day job. So it was quite a long day.

          <br>

          <span>I</span> remember when I was working at the pub, Mrs Watson said she had a surprize for me. At the back of the pub was the pub's private car park for the punters. So she said for me to follow her, & we went into the car park & she pointed to a car & said "Thats for You" as a present for all the hard work I had done since I had been there. It was a convertable car "Another Chick Puller".
          <a class ="nolink" href ="#">Triumph Vitesse Convertable.<span><img class = "triumph" src = "images/triumph.jpg" alt="image" width="320" height="250">
          <br>
          My Triumph Vitesse</span></a>

          Well you can imagine how excited I was. I was over the moon & not having to rely on late night buses anymore & could also take Bill out.
          <br>
          <br>
          <span>O</span>ne evening the other boss Bob arrived, & rushed into the pub shouting at me saying "What have you done?". I said what are you talking about! but all he kept saying was that I'm in deep trouble with the police & that I better find somewhere to hide, or better still leave the country. Well you can imagine by now my heart is racing & Bob said have you seen the news paper today & I said no, & on that note he pulled out a copy of the local newspaper & on the front page was a huge picture of me, with the headlines underneath... Have you seen this man? 'WANTED FOR RAPE'.
          <br>
          <span>C</span>an you imagine what that felt like. Seriously, panic set in....I started to shake felt sick & didn't know what to do. So I went and hid in the cellar behind the beer barrels. Anyway about 1/2 hour later I heard these voices coming down the cellar stairs & it was Bob with his mum laughing. Bob then said lets get back to the bar & I said NO! in case the police came in, & he said that will be highly unlikely.
          <br>
          <span>H</span>e had set me up!. It was a prank!. So then he told me that his other job is an editor for the newspaper, & he had taken my photo one evening without me seeing & had it developed. From this, they made a false front page of the paper using that photo of me & added in the text. Now Bob was about 6ft 4in tall, & because I was still shaking & now fuming after what he put me through, I called him out to the car park, but as time went on I cooled down and saw the funny side.(Glad I didn't take a swipe at him 😂)
          <br>
           <span>I</span> was feeling a bit down when I told Mrs Watson that I was leaving for Southend, & she welled up a bit. Quite sad really. I tried to see if I could E-Mail either of them in later years, but sadly the pub closed down, as you can see in the link above.


          <p class="careerclass">
          When I arrived in Southend, I applied for an engineering position at a company based in Rochford. The company was owned by a father & son who lived in Thorpe Bay near the Yacht club. I got the job & started a few days later. They manufactured "Dish Warmers" for restaurant tables, & I learnt everything there was to know about their products. It was great fun learning how to operate all the different types of machinery, from bending hugh sheets of metal, de-burring, linishing, drilling & assembling. There was also a small part of electrics which I liked.
          <br>
          <span>I</span> left the company a short time later, & it was in 1976 I saw this  advert about a government training scheme in electronics. So I phoned them up & made an appointment to go & see them. They were based in Chelmsford & I found out all the requirements to get on the course. One of my big worries was the up coming Maths exam & that a pass mark of 27 out of 30 was required, to enable me to get on the course. Well I went and bought books on Maths & any other books that I thought would help me to pass. I spent days & days just doing basic stuff division, fractions decimals etc & then progressing onto the more advanced stuff, until the big day of the exam.
          <br>
          <span>I</span> was really nervous but I came out with a pass mark of 27. I was over the moon & a date was set to start the course. Electronics was what I had always wanted to do & enjoyed every minute while I was on the course. After the course, Chris & I flew back to Rhodesia (1976) for a few weeks. I continued at night school studying electronics.

          <br>
          <br>

        <span>W</span>hen I first started work in the UK, I was always employed direct with a company & on a salary, & contributing to the PAYE system. I did this for a few years when I did manage to find work.

        
        <br>
          <span>A</span>fter that, I was freelancing, meaning I wasn't full time employed anymore with one company.
          <br>
          <span>I</span> remember the first day I went freelance. I was woking at a company testing power supplies for "Rank Zerox" duplicating machines, & another bloke who was doing the same job was freelance, & he told me the benefits of being self employed. So I phoned the agency this bloke was working for, quit my job as a permanent employee on the Friday, & came back to the same company on Monday (now on a freelance basis), with my pay almost doubling. Never looked back.
          <br>
          <br>
           <span>I</span> formed a Limited company called "Junifer Electronics", & took on contracts through other companies, or went in direct. The good news about feelancing, was that the money was significantly higher than being permanently employed & I was able to claim tax relief against a multitude of things, like fuel, wear & tear on the car, rail travel, food, customer entertainment etc. All that has changed now, as you can hardly claim on things like I used to.
          <br>
           <span>I</span> was earning above the maximum yearly allowance, so I had to register for VAT. What this meant is, I had to be very careful that I was charging the customer the correct amount & sending the correct amount to the Inland Revenue.
          And also, I could claim back the VAT that I spent on purchasing goods for the project.
          Every month I had a visit from the VAT man & he would go through my returns, & if it was wrong I was in big trouble but luckily, they were always correct.
          <br>
          <br>
          <span>W</span>ith being freelance meant I had the opportunity to travel. I had some brilliant contracts in many countries & great locations.
          <br>
