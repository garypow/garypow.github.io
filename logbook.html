<p class="p">
  A pilot logbook is a record of a pilot's flying hours. It contains every flight a pilot has flown, including flight time, number of landings, and types of instrument approaches made. Pilots also log simulator time, as it counts towards training.
</p>

<p class="p">
  In most countries, pilots are required to maintain a logbook, per their government's aviation regulations. The primary purpose is to show that certain requirements have been met for a certificate or rating, and for currency purposes.
  Used mostly by student and private pilots.  Details owners name and address, particulars of licences held, previous flying experience, handling notes, certificate of qualification as P1. Aircraft flown, aerodromes
  visited, record of simulated trainer practices and flights showing date, type, registration, captain's name, operating capacity, departure/arrival aerodromes and times, single or multi-engine, day or night, dual or p.2., instrument and simulated instrument times, remarks and carried forward totals.

<p class="p">
  The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) provides a sample logbook format in which all flights should be logged.[3] Information to be logged includes location and time of departure and arrival, the aircraft registration, the aircraft make, model and variant, the name of the pilot in command, whether the flight was single-pilot or multi-pilot, and for single-pilot flights whether the aircraft was single-engine or multi-engine. Time in an flight simulator (FSTD) is also logged.

  In addition to the requirements of Part-FCL.050, whether a flight was cross-country should also be logged for the issue of an airline transport pilot licence (ATPL).
