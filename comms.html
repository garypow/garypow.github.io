  To be honest, the Comms & Data side of the business was a small part. I never intentionally went out & hunted for Comms work, & the few jobs that I did do was through a friend, who was also in that type of business.
  <br>
  <span>H</span>e approached me one day & asked if I would be interested in doing some projects as a joint venture between our 2 companies, as it was too big for him to handle on his own.
  <br>
   <span>W</span>ell as it happens, I was waiting for the start date on my next project, so had a bit of time to spare.
  <br>
  <span>W</span>e made many pre-site visits & regular meetings with the client, & made changes, as items were added or removed.</p>
  
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p class="commsclass">
  <span>T</span>he 3 Companies were:-
  <br>
  <span>American</span> Bank (London City)
  <br>
  <span>Allied</span> Irish Bank (London City)
  <br>
  <span>NatWest</span> Bank (London City)
  <br>
  <br>
<span>T</span>hese 3 projects were almost identical. They were all in the Financial part of the city. We did all 3 projects on a Turnkey basis. The customers requested us to supply all installation materials including the set up/design of the Central Apparatus Room where all the equipment racks were installed. We wired in the 3 Phase electrical system from each equipment rack back to the main elecrical board (already installed back to sub station). We had around 20 racks in each facility, which we fitted out with Mains Distribution Units, 10 BaseT Servers, Switchers, Patch panels, Routers & feeds to the main Uplink & Downlink satellites & a whole lot more.
<br>
<br>
<span>O</span>n top of this, we supplied full blown schematic diagrams & wiring schedules for the installation teams & made sure there was enough labour to complete the project.
<br>
<span>W</span>e completed all 3 projects on time & within budget & the clients were very impressed with the final outcome, which resulted in us being called again to upgrade the systems.

<br>
<br>

<span>J</span>ust out of interest, Today, there are 4,852 active artificial satellites orbiting the Earth as of January 2022, of which a staggering 2,944 belong to the United States. This is the largest number of any single country, with their nearest competitor, China, accounting for only 499.
<br>
Just goes to show how the Communications industry has grown since I was involved in it in 1976 with around 200 or less satellites orbiting the Earth.
