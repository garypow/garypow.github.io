I Freelanced as an Audio Installation & Test Engineer for "Turnkey Studio Systems" based in Hendon, North London. It was really convenient for me, as at the time I was living in North London & it was just a 20 minute drive away. Turnkey, was a well established company with a lot of talent in the way of Acoustics, Audio Equipment, Engineering, Sales, to full blown projects. Below are all the projects I was involved with on a sub contracting basis:-

It is a keyboard, but compared to a piano there was so much difference. The Synclavier could sound like a piano, but a piano couldn't sound like a Synclavier.
<br>
It could produce sounds from a single violin for example, to a full chior or, to a full orchestra. A Synclavier could cost anywhere from $25,000 to $200,000
<br>
<br>
It had widespread use among producers and professional recording studios, competing at times with high-end production systems such as the Fairlight.

This is the actual DDA AMR24 Mixer with the Audio effects behind the chairs, that I installed in 'Astoria'.</span></a>
<br>
<br>

<span>W</span>e arrived at the house boat on the first day of the project, & had all the equipment delivered from "Turnkey". The fun bit as always was assembling the Audio Mixer, & setting up all the glue, then wiring it all together & finally testing the system out.


<br>
<span>T</span>he master bedroom, was converted into a machine room, where we housed the power amplifiers, all the tape machines (VTR's), camera supplies and that sort of stuff. The room at the other end of the boat was converted so it could be used as a live room if required, running mic lines, red lights, foldback, CCTV, etc. And then air conditioning systems were put in the machine room and control room. The control room was secondarily glazed. We installed A new DDA AMR24 Mixer. A crane barge and a tug were used to get both the tape machines in through a window opening in to the master bedroom on the far side of the boat and the air conditioning unit for the control room on to the roof. There were the Turnkey crew, who had been doing the whole installation as well other different tradesmen, getting in each other's way in a fairly confined space with desk installation, wiring, electric, carpentry, glazing, air con, CCTV, decorating, etc., with the floors up and all going on at the same time and had to get the place finished and running to be ready for use.
<br>
 We managed to complete the project on time.
 <br>
 <br>

 This was by far, the best experience of my working life. Pink Floyd is my favourite band & having been given the oportunity to have done this "Astoria" project was a dream for me. I met David when he arrived at the house boat & I was fortunate to have been able to chat with him. Really nice man. It's a shame that the project had to come to an end.
