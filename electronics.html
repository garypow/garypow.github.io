  I was engaged by the following companies as an electronics Test Engineer & bench wiring of Electronic equipment.
  <br>
  Some of these projects were really exciting as well as a challenge. Others I didn't enjoy too much.
  <br>
  There was so many different companies during this period that were screaming out for freelancers, as the Electronics industry was expanding so fast, that it didn't really worry me as to when my contract was coming to an end, as I knew there was always more work after the current one finished.
  <br>
  That was the beauty of freelancing, in the way that if you didn't like your current job, you could always resign on the spot, as there was no notice to give, being a contractor.
  <br>
  These companies would pay more money as well, to try to hang on, & retain you, so you don't jump ship to one of their rivals, as there were not enough freelancers on the scene.
  <br>
  <br>

  <span>P</span>lessey Aerospace (Romford).
  I was on contract as a Progress Chaser. The work entailed progressing all the outstanding & incomplete jobs for the Ministry Of Defense (M.O.D). The boss of the company at the Monday morning meeting would issue each one of us, a different list of all undelivered purchase orders placed by the M.O.D of spare parts for different types of military aircraft. It was my job as well as all the other chasers to basically 'clear the list'.
  <br>
  <br>
   We had a daily morning group meeting with the boss who would expect results, & if any of the chasers didn't produce, he would really tear into the slackers (had my share). Fascinating job to chase down parts, go outside to manufactures & get firm delivery dates, & get them delivered to site. Once all the components were available, we would then issue a works order to the shop floor to get the part assembled & completed, & more importantly prevent a bollocking from the boss. Absolutely loved that job. The main completed products were mainly Rotor arms & Magnetos.

  <br>
  <span>G</span>ilbarco (Basildon)
  This contract was the assembly of custom made cable looms for the production of Gilbarco Petrol Pumps. This job involved working from schematic diagrams, cutting the relevent cables, terminating the correct connector, connecting the cables to the correct component & to producing the finished article, where it was installed into the main pump housing to monitor the amount of petrol being delivered & the price to the car.
  <br>
  <br>
  <span>N</span>olton Communications (Waltham Abbey)
  This was an exciting contract. I was a test engineer, testing out & fault finding UHF & VHF Mobile Radio's used in the Police, Ambulance & fire departments vehicles, to communicate between other vehicles or the station.
  <br>
   We would recieve the unit with a fault sheet describing the problem, & from that information, it was my job to ascertain why the unit wasn't working. This meant trouble shooting the electronics down to component level & replacing damaged/burnt out components.
  <br>
  We would then have to test the unit once it was repaired, then hand it back to the customer with a detailed report on what the problem was & what action was taken. Loved this job.
  <br>
  <br>
  <span>G</span>ould Advance (Essex)
  <br>
  On contract as a test engineer. My job was testing heavy duty power supplies & constant voltage transformers. The testing had to be so precise, & working within such small tolerances. This job was great fun & always different reasons why the units fail, from bad workmanship, to missing components. All in a days work!.
  <br>
  <br>
  <span>S.T.C</span> (Basildon)
  This was a short term contract wiring up different electronic devices. Pretty repetetive work actually & got extremely bored, so quit that contract pretty quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  <span>S.T.C</span> (New Southgate)
  Not a lot of difference between this & the Basildon site. Again not a very enjoyable job & very repetitious work. Not a lot more I can add.
